## How Topology Is Applied to Gestalt Principles in Auditory Perception
**Format:** Talk slides (PPT)  
**Keywords:** TDA, persistent homology, Gestalt principles, auditory perception, structure, invariance

**Short abstract**  
This talk explores how **topological summaries** (e.g., persistent homology) can encode structure in signals, and how these descriptors can be interpreted through the lens of **Gestalt principles** in auditory perception (grouping, continuity, similarity, salience). I focus on what “structure” should mean for robust perception under noise and variation, and how representation choices can be guided by perceptual principles.

**What I covered**
- Why topology can serve as a language for “structure” that is stable under perturbations
- How to transform auditory signals / feature sequences into objects suitable for topological analysis
- How Gestalt principles can guide the choice of features, filtrations, and what counts as meaningful persistence
- Open questions: evaluation, interpretability, and bridging “principles” to computational mechanisms
