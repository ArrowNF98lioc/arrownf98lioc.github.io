## Machine Learning Final Report: Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving
**Topic:** Semantic segmentation as a core perception module for autonomous driving, with attention to robustness and deployment constraints.

**Summary**  
Semantic segmentation provides pixel-level understanding of driving scenes (roads, lanes, vehicles, pedestrians, signs), making it a key component for safety-critical planning and decision-making. This report reviews representative model families and practical challenges, and summarizes directions that improve robustness, efficiency, and reliability in real-world conditions.

**What’s inside**
- Motivation: why pixel-level perception matters for safety and planning
- Model families and design patterns: encoder–decoder pipelines and representative segmentation approaches
- Practical challenges:
  - weather / illumination shift and domain generalization
  - real-time constraints and efficiency
  - small-object segmentation
  - annotation scarcity and label noise
  - class imbalance
  - multimodal fusion (optional)
  - interpretability and reliability
