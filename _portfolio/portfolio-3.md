## Academic Talk

### Gestalt Principles in Auditory Perception (TDA + Gestalt)
**Format:** Talk slides (PPT)  
**Focus:** Connecting Gestalt-style grouping and salience in auditory perception with topological summaries (e.g., persistent homology), aiming for interpretable, structure-aware representations.

**What I covered**
- Why “structure” in perception can be framed as invariants under noise and deformation
- How a signal or feature sequence can be turned into geometric objects suitable for topological analysis
- How Gestalt principles (grouping, continuity, similarity, salience) can guide what to treat as meaningful structure

**Slides**
- PPTX

## Seminar Lecture Notes (3)

These notes are written for reading-group style seminars. They prioritize clear definitions, proof skeletons, and implementation-oriented intuition when applicable.

### 1) Set Theory Seminar Notes
**Theme:** Axiom of Choice and equivalent formulations  
**Includes**
- Core statements and intuition (choice functions, well-ordering)
- Typical equivalences and proof structures (Zorn’s Lemma style arguments)
- Key takeaways for how these tools are used in later mathematics

**Files**
- PDF

### 2) Fourier Analysis Seminar Notes
**Theme:** Poisson Summation Formula and its central consequences  
**Includes**
- Schwartz space viewpoint and the idea of periodization
- A clean derivation path for Poisson summation
- Connections to classical special functions and uncertainty principles

**Files**
- PDF

### 3) Extremal Combinatorics Notes
**Theme:** Extremal methods at the interface of combinatorics and geometry  
**Includes**
- Modeling geometric constraints via graphs (distance graphs as a guiding example)
- Constructive lower bounds and inequality-based upper bounds
- How parameter choices shape the final bound

## Course Report

### Machine Learning Final Report: Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving
**Topic:** Semantic segmentation as a core perception module for autonomous driving, with attention to robustness and deployment constraints.

**What’s inside**
- Motivation: why pixel-level perception matters for safety and planning
- Model families and design patterns: FCN-style ideas, encoder-decoder structures, and representative segmentation pipelines
- Practical challenges: weather and illumination shifts, real-time constraints, small objects, annotation scarcity, class imbalance, multimodal fusion, interpretability
- Discussion of limitations and directions for improvement

**Report**
- PDF

- **Summary (short)**:  
  A course report that formulates the problem clearly, sets up reproducible experiments, and discusses results with appropriate baselines and limitations.
